        <p>
            As an IT technician, my one time goal is to contribute
            to the tech industry's growth. I want to make my mark and leave this world
            of technology a better place than i found it. I know i can push myself and 
            achieve more than i can imagine.
        </p>
        <p>
            Specifically, i want to help build a new internet network into the world
            and imply my skills there. I can handle both the filed part if working as 
            a technician and i can also handle the computing part in terms of cyber security
            where my mathematics applies.
        </p>
        <p>
            In about a few years i want to learn as much as possible as i can. besides
            helping bringing up a new network i also want to build programs and further 
            my skills in programming.
        </p>
        <p>
            Later on, looking back i want to have achieved all that i plan on today and 
            get motivated t do more. I also want to help my home people with knowledge that 
            i have and make their life easier as they have all helped me get here where i am 
            now.
